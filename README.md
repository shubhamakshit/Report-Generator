üöÄ DocuPDF: Smart Scanner & PDF Generator

DocuPDF is a web-based utility that transforms images of documents‚Äîlike test papers, notes, or book pages‚Äîinto a polished, organized, and enhanced PDF. It mimics the functionality of modern mobile scanner apps, providing a powerful 8-point perspective crop, image enhancement tools, and detailed metadata entry, all within your browser.

<br>




‚ú® Key Features

Multi-File Upload: Upload multiple images at once. The app intelligently sorts them based on numbers in the filenames (e.g., IMG_001.jpg, IMG_002.jpg).

Scanner-Like Cropping: A powerful and intuitive 8-point perspective correction tool lets you define the exact boundaries of your document, even if the photo was taken at an angle.

Touch-Friendly UI: The cropping interface is fully responsive and touch-friendly, complete with a magnifying loupe for pixel-perfect precision on any device.

Image Enhancement: Fine-tune your scans with adjustments for brightness, contrast, and gamma to ensure maximum readability.

Detailed Data Entry: Add structured metadata to each image, such as Question Number, Subject, Status (Correct/Wrong/Unattempted), and more.

Quality-of-Life Tools:

"Same Subject for All" toggle to quickly fill in subject details.

"Disable Time" checkbox for questions where time tracking is not applicable.

Custom PDF Generation:

Combine all your processed images into a single A4 PDF.

Customize the number of images per page (1, 2, 4, 6, or 8).

Filter the PDF to include only "All," "Wrong," or "Unattempted" questions.

Modern Dark Theme: An elegant and easy-on-the-eyes dark theme powered by Bootstrap 5.

üîß Tech Stack

Backend: Flask (Python)

Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow

Frontend: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript (for interactive cropping and UI logic)

Dependencies: requests (for a font-fetching fallback)
